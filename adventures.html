                <p>For many years I had wanted to visit The Culinary Institute of America campus in St. Helena, Ca.  This amazing campus is located in the heart of the Napa Valley. Built in 1889 for Greystone Cellars this 117,000 square foot building is now the home of CIA.  I was able to visit this campus in 2015 when 2 of my baking friends asked if I would attend a boot camp with them.  I couldn’t sign up fast enough and patiently waited for 3 months for that first day to start.
                </p>
                <p>
                Our Boot Camp was focused on "all things baking".  My knowledge and endurance was stretched to a new level and at a few points I wasn't sure if I was going to make it through. I quickly learned the difference between home baking and mass production baking under a strict time crunch. We spent each morning in class and each afternoon in the kitchen making hundreds of loaves of bread, cookies, pies and cakes. By 5-6pm each day we had groups of fellow students, employees and residents awaiting our creations. I do have to say…..we never let them down.
                </p>
                <p>
                While in Napa Valley we spent our extra down time touring the local winery's, restaurants and breathtaking landscape. My top pick for winery tours would be Castello di Amorosa.  Not only will this winery blow your mind architecturally but you will taste some of the best wine in the area. Other top highlights include The Model Bakery (best english muffins), Woodhouse Chocolates and the cozy old town of Calistoga where you will find the famous hot springs. This 1 week CIA/NAPA experience rates at the very top of my all time favorites list. I am hoping to one day attend a class or two at the CIA Hyde Park, New York Campus.

            As a fan of The Food Network I was thrilled to be asked as a guest on Giada's first season of Giada Entertains. The episode was titled  "Tis the Season" in which Giada kicked off the holiday season with a wonderful open house. We ate, we drank, we laughed and before I knew it I had forgotten that the cameras were rolling.
            It goes without saying that Giada really knows how to entertain. Not only was the food and drink top notch but she was kind enough to send us all home with a personalized gift. I took away many inventive decorating ideas, some great new recipes and best of all developed some new friendships. This was definitely a fun experience that I will forever remember.
            </p>
            <p><b>You can find my favorite recipe from the episode below. It is definitely a crowd pleaser!</b>
