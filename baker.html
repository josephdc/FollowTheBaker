            <h2>Meet Baker Brian Williams</h2>
            <p>
              As a child I was always intrigued with all things baking.  Having a mother who enjoyed being in the kitchen helped fuel my interest in the culinary world. At first it was a way to have constant sweets around the house, but over time it became a hobby and passion. While in college I worked as a “manny”.  This gave me the opportunity to try out different treats and recipes on the kids.  I have always connected with the under 12 crowd and to this day enjoy being able to help kids learn to bake and gain confidence.  For the past 25 years I have been in the Real Estate business primarily in New Home Sales and Property Management.   I have been fortunate enough to be able to work part time.  This has given me the opportunity to spend my extra time enjoying and perfecting my baking skills.
              For the past 5 years I have been exploring every opportunity to further my knowledge.  I have carefully picked out specific recreational classes, boot camps and have immersed myself in all of the online baking content I could find.  I have participated in classes at Culinary Institute of America, Bleu Ribbon Kitchen at Cordon Bleu, Gourmandise School of Sweets and Savories, Institute of Domestic Technology, Surface, Sur La Table and more.  I have found that taking bits and pieces of knowledge from many different chefs has given me a well rounded knowledge of the baking world.  Through this process I have gained some wonderful friends who continue to push me to get better.
              <br/>
              I have gathered many important baking secrets, techniques and recipes and now help others expand their baking skills by doing in home classes. From kid’s birthday parties to adult groups wanting something different on a Friday night, I love bringing joy to the kitchen.   I have recently done volunteer work with the Autism community and continue to search for opportunities to help others feel confident in the kitchen while smiling and laughing along the way.
              As I continue to educate and explore I am hoping to take my travels and training to other states and even countries.  I feel it is important to always keep learning, smiling and encouraging others along the way.  Follow me on my adventures and we can learn together.
